Yet, several satisfying simulation models exhibiting natural pedestrians or group emerging behaviors exist. Choosing among these model generally depends on the considered crowd density or the topology of the environment. Conversely, achieving a user-desired kinematic or dynamic pattern at a given instant of the simulation reveals to be much more tedious. In this paper, a novel generic control methodology is proposed to solve this crowd editing issue. Our method relies on an adjoint formulation of the underlying optimization procedure. It is independent to a certain extent of the choice of the simulation model, and is designed to handle several forms of constraints. A variety of examples attesting the benefits of our approach are proposed, along with quantitative performance measures.}},

    author = {Allain, Pierre and Courty, Nicolas and Corpetti, Thomas},
    abstract = {{Controlling several and possibly independent moving agents in order to reach global goals is a tedious task that has applications in many engineering fields such as robotics or computer animation. Together, the different agents form a whole called swarm, which may display interesting collective behaviors. When the agents are driven by their own dynamics, controlling this swarm is known as the particle swarm control problem. In that context, several strategies, based on the control of individuals using simple rules, exist. This paper defends a new and original method based on a centralized approach. More precisely, we propose a framework to control several particles with constraints either expressed on a per-particle basis, or expressed as a function of their environment. We refer to these two categories as respectively Lagrangian or Eulerian constraints. The contributions of the paper are the following: (i) we show how to use optimal control recipes to express an optimization process over a large state space including the dynamic information of the particles; and (ii) the relation between the Lagrangian state space and Eulerian values is conveniently expressed with graph operators that make it possible to conduct all the mathematical operations required by the control process. We show the effectiveness of our approach on classical and more original particle swarm control problems.}},

Through this Laplacian representation of the motion, we propose an application which allows an easy and interactive editing, correction or retargeting of a motion. The new created motion is the result of the combination of two minimizations, linear and non-linear: the first penalizes the difference of energy between the Laplacian coordinates from an animation to the desired one. The other one preserves the length of segments. Using several examples, we demonstrate the benefits of our method and in particularly the preservation of the spatiotemporal properties of the motion in an interactive context.}},

    abstract = {{W}e describe in this paper a system for automatically synthesizing deaf signing animations from motion data captured on real deaf subjects. {M}oreover, we create a virtual agent endowed with expressive gestures. {O}ur attention is focused on the expressiveness of gesture (what type of gesture: fluidity, tension, anger) and on its semantic representations. {O}ur approach relies on a data-driven animation scheme. {F}rom motion data captured thanks to an optical system and data gloves, we try to extract relevant features of communicative gestures, and to re-synthesize them afterwards with style variation. {W}ithin this framework, a motion database containing the whole body, hands motion and facial expressions has been built. {T}he analysis of signals makes possible the enrichment of this database by including segmentation and annotation descriptors. {A}nalysis and synthesis algorithms are applied to the generation of a set of {F}rench {S}ign {L}anguage gestures. {K}ey words {C}ommunication for deaf people, sign language gestures, virtual signer agent, gesture database.},

    abstract = {{T}his paper presents an original solution to the camera control problem in a virtual environment. {O}ur objective is to present a general framework that allows the automatic control of a camera in a dynamic environment. {T}he proposed method is based on the image-based control or visual servoing approach. {I}t consists in positioning a camera according to the information perceived in the image. {T}his is thus a very intuitive approach of animation. {T}o be able to react automatically to modifications of the environment, we also considered the introduction of constraints into the control. {T}his approach is thus adapted to highly reactive contexts (virtual reality, video games). {N}umerous examples dealing with classic problems in animation are considered within this framework and presented in this paper.},
