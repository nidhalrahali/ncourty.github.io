Following some recent works on geodesic analysis on that particular manifold, we propose a method which purpose is to select a subset of input data by sampling the corresponding hypersphere. The selected data should represent correctly the input data, while also maximizing the diversity. We show how these two opposite objectives can be characterized in terms of Karcher variance optimization. The corresponding algorithms are defined and results are reported on toy datasets. This shows the interest of working on the kernelized festure space instead of the input space.}},

Manual segmentation of objects in videos is indeed one of the most time-consuming type of assisted labeling. A big gap in computer vision research can not be filled due to this lack of temporally dense and precise segmentation ground truth on large video samples. Such data is indeed essential to introduce machine learning tech- niques for automatic pedestrian segmentation, as well as many other applications involving occluded people. We present a new dataset of 1.8 million pedestrian silhouettes presenting human-to-human occlusion patterns likely to be seen in real crowd video data. To our knowledge, it is the first publicly available large dataset of pedestrian in crowd silhouettes. Solutions to generate and represent this data are detailed. We discuss ideas of how this ground truth can be used for a large number of computer vision applications and demonstrate it on a camera calibration toy problem.}},

In the case of the Gaussian kernel however, data are distributed on a hypersphere in the corresponding Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). Inspired by previous works in non-linear tatistics, this article investigates the use of dedicated tools to take into account this particular geometry. Within this geometrical interpretation of the kernel theory, Riemannian distances are preferred over Euclidean distances. It is shown that this amounts to consider a new kernel and its corresponding RKHS. Experiments on real publicly available datasets show the possible benefits of the method on clustering tasks, notably through the definition of a new variant of kernel k-means on the hypersphere. Classification problems are also considered in a classwise setting. In both cases, the results show improvements over standard techniques.}},

However, with the help of good dimensionality reduction methods, this problem can be alleviated. Yet, it appears that the intitial motion representation space if of great importance with regards to the final performances. This paper advocates the idea that the distance representation space (i.e. ensemble of joint-to-joint distances of the skeleton), though bigger, can yield a powerful representation of the motion. In order to validate this idea, comparisons with rotation and position based representations are experimented in a motion retrieval task performed with the HDM05 motion database. The final resulting retrieval algorithm is very fast with satisfying performances.}},
